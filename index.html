                I’ve always loved challenges and puzzles. Something about working through a problem in the most efficient manner always scratches some deep-seated itch I’ve had since childhood. I think that’s one of the things that has led me to pursue a career as a full stack web developer. I’d been coding off and on (mostly off) for about 2 years when I decided to finally take the plunge to pursue this calling with SMU’s Full Stack Web Development Certification.

                Previously, I had worked my way through the standard business major graduation careers (banking and insurance). I met some great people along the way and learned way more than I would’ve thought possible in 3 years but always felt like something was missing. I genuinely enjoyed every day, but there was always that nagging feeling I was missing something. One day, it just hit me. I wanted to create something! I wanted to feel proud of what I had made and work with a team who felt the same way. 
                <br><br>
                Since then, I’ve pursued this career with a passion I didn’t know that I had in me. I’m still learning, but that’s true of all of us, isn’t it? I’m certain that I’ll continue to improve day after day and that I’ll enjoy every minute of it. I am a Web Developer.
